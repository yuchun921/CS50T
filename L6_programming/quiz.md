#### Scratch
Head to scratch.mit.edu and sign up for an account on MIT’s website by clicking "Join Scratch" atop the page. Any username (that’s available) is fine, but take care to remember it and your choice of password.

Then head to https://scratch.mit.edu/ideas and take note of the resources available to you before you dive into Scratch itself. In particular, you might want to try out the Getting Started tutorial for Scratch at https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=getStarted.

Now it’s time to choose your own adventure! Your mission is, quite simply, to have fun with Scratch and implement a project of your choice (be it an animation, a game, interactive art, or anything else), subject only to the following requirements:

* Your project must have at least two sprites, at least one of which must resemble something other than a cat.
* Your project must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).
* Your project must use at least one condition, one loop, and one variable.
* Your project must use at least one sound.
* Your project must use standard Scratch blocks only to satisfy the above requirements (no add-ons).
* Your project should be more complex than most of those demonstrated in lecture (many of which, though instructive, were quite short) but it can be less complex than Oscartime. As such, your project should probably use a few dozen puzzle pieces overall.

Once finished with your project, click See project page in Scratch’s top-right corner. Ensure your project has a title (in Scratch’s top-left corner), some instructions (in Scratch’s top-right corner), and some notes and/or credits (in Scratch’s bottom-right corner). Then click Share in Scratch’s top-right corner so that others can see your project. Finally, take note of the URL in your browser’s address bar. That’s your project’s URL on MIT’s website. Your response should look exactly like this: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/XXXXXXXXX (where XXXXXXXXX is a nine-digit number).

- What's your project’s URL on MIT’s website?

- Can we share your name, city/state/country, and Scratch project with others online?

	>   ◼ Yes
	>   ◻ No 

- Write a program in pseudocode (i.e., step-by-step instructions in English) with which a human (or, if you prefer, a robot) could make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich (correctly).  
  <p style="font-size:small">You may assume that the human (or robot) has access to a loaf of bread, a jar of peanut butter, a jar of jelly, a plate, and a knife, but may assume nothing beyond that.</p>

	>   1. take peanut butter
	>   2. open peanut butter
	>   3. take bread
	>   4. take knife
	>   5. cut bread with a knife
	>   6. spread peanut butter on a bread with a knife
	>   7. take jelly
	>   8. open jelly
	>   9. spread jelly on another brad
	>   10. Combine two breads with peanut butter and jelly inwards
	>   11. put the breads on the plate

- What is a Boolean expression? Provide an example (in English or pseudocode) of one.  

	>   Boolean expression is to evaluate whether the condition is true or not.
	>	Example: "smith is earlier in book" or "it is raining outside"
  
- What does it mean to compile a program?

	>   Convert human-readable information into machine code that computers can read  

- Why do we sometimes break our code out into separate functions, rather than one large program?

	>   break our code out into separate functions will more readable and reusability  
	>	If you need to reuse some code block, it will be more convenient to write a function.  

- What does it mean for a program to be multithreaded?

	>   multithreaded can execute multiple code or instructions at the same time
