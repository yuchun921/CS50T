- Even though HTML is, per its own acronym, a language, why would it be incorrect to call HTML a programming language?  

	>   HTML doesn't give us the ability to command the computer to do things, it doesn't have control flow(like loops), conditions, variables.  

- In your own words, what is the action attribute of an HTML form used for?

	>   Form tag collect data submitted to specific websites.   

- What is a CSS selector?

	>   CSS selector will tell the browser which HTML tags should choose, and then apply the rules defined in CSS to it.  

- Among the HTTP status codes below, which is commonly used to instruct a browser to check its cache for the requested resource?

	>   ◻ 200
	>   ◻ 302
	>   ◼ 304
	>   ◻ 401
	>   ◻ 404
  

- Among the HTTP status codes below, which suggests a server error rather than a client error?  

	>   ◻ 200
	>   ◻ 301
	>   ◻ 403
	>   ◻ 418
	>   ◼ 500
  

#### Dive into HTML
For this challenge, you might find it helpful to skim or search http://htmldog.com/guides/html/ and http://htmldog.com/guides/css/, which build upon concepts from lecture. Here, we'll use a site called replit.com, which provides a lightweight online IDE for writing simple programs. We recommend you log in using your GitHub account at replit.com before beginning (this will make it a lot easier to find and rename your "repl"s if you need to go back), but it is also okay to create so-called "repl"s anonymously.

Visit https://replit.com/@dlloyd09/CS50xCourseWebsite. First, at the top, click "Fork"; then a new "repl" unique to you will be created. There you'll find a basic website started by Doug, with mostly-empty files index.html and styles.css.

Now let’s have you make an actual website with multiple pages. To view (and thus test!) your web page, remember to click the Run button at the top to open your website in the embedded browser. Be sure things work as expected before you submit! 

We’ll leave its design largely up to you, subject only to the following requirements:

1. Your website's main page should live in index.html, since most web servers serve up index.html by default, in the absence of an explicit file name in a URL.
2. Your website must include a least one other page (with any filename, so long as it ends in .html), and your website's main page (i.e., index.html) must somehow link to that page. You can click "Add File" icon at the top of the embedded file browser to add a new file to your "repl".
3. Your website must include at least one image. Note that the embedded file browser also has a mechanism for uploading files from your computer, though you may also use images already on the internet.
4. Your website must be stylized with at least several CSS properties, which must live in styles.css (an "external stylesheet"), just as we saw (briefly) in css4.html. Your CSS needs to ultimately end up connected to your HTML, as well.
5. Your website should be more complex than those from class (but much less complex than Harvard's home page!). As such, your website should probably use a few dozen HTML tags overall, plus several CSS properties.

Alright, make us proud!
